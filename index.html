				<p>Daily shoots at studio as from 3pm till late. This has

			<P>Payments for any services received should be done through bank.
			A client is not permited any more to pay before he or she gets a
			receipt. There are talks to review the rates of services but yet
			to come out with a define conclusion. This has come into existance
		due to having many scenerios of clients not paying as earlier agreed
	upon. It also draws its motives from the bases of the needed of having 
proof of participating in KennyShoots.</P>
